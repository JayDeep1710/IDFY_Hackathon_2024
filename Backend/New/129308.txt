Valley winery
with a
singular vision: to create wines that stand among
the world' $ finest: This Cabernet Sauvignon showcases
outstanding vineyards in the geographic center ofthe
Valley. Fruit characteristics, such as blackberry
and cassis, combined with spicy oak elements, lead to an
elegant structure, with velvety tannins and excellent
length. A
classic.
