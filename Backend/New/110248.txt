California is blessed with many historic Zinfandel vineyards.
These grapes were first planted by European immigrants in
the early 1900s and are still producing today:
The old head-trained vines are unique because they produce
smaller crop of fruit that is unusually rich and concentrated.
In selecting grapes from these old vines, we have handcrafted
a wine that displays intense blackberry black cherry and rasp _
berry flavors, wrapped in a smooth blanket of vanilla and oak
We at Bogle salute these old vineyards and those pioneers
who brought their dreams and visions to California.
