JUSTIN
Cireat wine
begins with the
best soil and the best climate_
JUSTIN Vineyards is blessed
With both. Rich in limestone, our
Soil combines with
a unique
inicroclimate to produce ripe,
intensely flavored grapes: Then,
We: employ artisanal  techniques
typically reserved for the most
revered labels, such as hand-
harvesting; hand-sorting; and small
oak barrel aging:
The result?
JUSTIN Cabernet Sauvignon,
beautifully balanced, with aromas
of black fruit and spice:
