BIO FLOC
TECHONLOGY
Prior to
bottling; a special conditioning period places the nitrifying bacteria
into a dormant state to ensure
product stability, efficacy and purity:
During this time; the bacteria naturally create a protective film (or "flocs")
and can be reactivated simply by shaking the bottle before application.
